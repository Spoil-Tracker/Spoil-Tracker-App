# Getting Started

After cloning the repository to your computer, open the cloned folder in VS Code. Once you're in VS Code, open it's terminal and type in the command: `cd spoil-tracker-alpha`

Once this has been completed, you’ll need to install the dependencies needed for the program to function correctly. With the terminal still open, type: `npm install`

Next, in order for the backend to work, the next command you’ll need to type is: `npm install graphql graphql-scalars type-graphql` then after that’s done: `npm install reflect-metadata` 

In order to test if the project is up and running on your machine, make sure you're still in the `spoil-tracker-alpha` folder in the terminal and type: `npx expo start` 
which will show you a QR code along with with a few options to open the application.

Press w to open the web version of the app. You should see a white page that says `Edit app/index.tsx to edit this screen.` If you see this message, you’re all set!
